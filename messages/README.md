# messages
1. I believe I correctly implemented all parts of this lab. I modified the JS function loadMessages to parse the JSON and output the messages in the correct order in the "messages" section of the HTML.

2. I worked on this lab by myself.

3. I spent about an hour working on this lab because I got stuck trying to figure out how to output both elements of the json array without overriding the previous one in the "messages" section. Otherwise, the rest was pretty straightforward.
