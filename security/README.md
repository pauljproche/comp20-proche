1. As far as I can tell, all aspects of the lab have been correctly implemented. Using the Burp Suite tool and curl I was able to have my index.html document contain an introduction section, a methodology section, an abstract of findings, a section dedicated to the multitude of issues with the server-vuln.js and finally a conclusion section which listed future considerations and recommendations.

2. I worked on this lab by myself.

3. I spent approximately 4-5 hours on this lab.
