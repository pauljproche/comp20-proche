			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<div>I am perform a security assessment of a potentially vulnerable system. Specifically, I was hired as a security consultant to resolve privacy and security issues relating to a ride-hailing service. That is, I was hired to see if there were any notable vulnerablities in the source code and the package.json by the company.</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<h2>I will follow a two-step process of attacking the site</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Blackbox Approach: I will first perform attacks without reading the source code.</li>
				<li>Whitebox Approach: Then, I will manually review the source code and document my findings. If I find any large issues, such as source code that is potentially vulnerable to XSS, I will go back and attack it.</li>
			</li>
			<h2>Summary:</h2>
			<div>My methodology for pen testing the system will be to first understand the source code of the ride hailing service, the see if there are any apparent vulnerabilities that I can desern from the code, and final I will use tools such the OWASP ZAP tool, curl, and the playing with the URL's browser to locate vulnerabilities. I will loop through this process until I am certain that there are no more serious security and privacy issues with the ride-hailing service.</div>
		</div>

			<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
			<h2>Overview of all the security and privacy issues identified:</h2>
			<div>Types of Issues and Vulnerabilities Found</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Directives are not defined (i.e. CSP Scanner: Wildcard Directive)</li>
				<li>Protection against 'Clickjacking' attacks does not exist (i.e. X-Frame-Options Header Not Set)</li>
				<li>Website is susceptible to hackers forcing the user to send information without their knowledge (i.e.Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens)</li>
				<li>The website lacks protection of the users against harmful code sent by hackers(i.e. Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled)</li>
				<li>The Website is vulnerable to targeted code and the hacker can gain control to a victim's browser and account.(i.e. XSS)</li>
				<li>Code can be inserted such that sensitive information from this company's databases can be stolen or leaked (i.e. NoSQL Injection)</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Issues Found Via BlackBox Method</h1>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 1: CSP Scanner: Wildcard Directive</li>

					<li>Location: Inside the response header (i.e. upgrade-insecure-requests; frame-ancestors 'self')</li>

					<li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>

					<li>Description of issue: The following directives either allow wildcard sources,
					 are not defined, or are overly broadly defined: script-src, style-src, img-src, connect-src, frame-src, font-src, media-src, object-src, manifest-src, worker-src, prefetch-src.</li>

					<li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="../security/issue1_proof.png" alt="issue 1" width="268" height="400"></li>

					<li>Resolution: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 2: X-Frame-Options Header Not Set</li>

					<li>Location: Doesn't exist inside the HTTP Response</li>

					<li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>

					<li>Description of issue: X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.</li>

					<li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="../security/issue2.png" alt="issue 2" width="268" height="400"></li>

					<li>Resolution: Ensure that the X-Frame-Options HTTP header is set on all web pages returned by your site.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 3: Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</li>
					<li>Location: &lt form id="search" action=/search method="get" class="searchbar js-searchbar " autocomplete="off"&gt </li>
					<li>Severity of issue: Low</li>
					
					<li>Description of issue: No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form. A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. Thus,  the lack of such tokens would for instance allow one one-click attacks to occur.</li>
					
					<li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="../security/issue3.png" alt="issue 3" width="268" height="400"></li>
					<li>Resolution: Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 4: Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled</li>
					<li>Location: Missing X-XSS HTTP Response Header</li>
					<li>Severity of issue: Low</li>
					<li>Description of issue: Web Browser XSS Protection is not enabled, or is disabled by the configuration of the 'X-XSS-Protection' HTTP response header on the web server.</li>
					<li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="../security/issue4.png" alt="issue 4" width="268" height="400"></li>
					<li>Resolution: Ensure that the web browser's XSS filter is enabled. </li>
				</ul>

			<h1>Issues found via Whitebox Method</h1>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting</li>
					<li>Location: POST /rides </li>
					<li>Severity of issue: High</li>
					<li>Description of issue: XSS vulnerabilities target scripts embedded in a page that are executed on the client-side, rather than on the server-side. Thus, it can lead to an attacker controlling the victimâ€™s browser or account on the vulnerable web application.</li>
					<li>Proof of vulnerability: For instance, executing "curl --data "username=&ltscript&gtalert('Hello XSS')&lt/script&gt&lat=50&lng=50" https://hans-moleman.herokuapp.com/rides" on the console triggers the following:
					<img src="../security/realsolution5.png" alt="issue 5" width="600" height="300"> </li>
					<li>Resolution: Remove the ability for data to be interpreted as code. </li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 2: NoSQL Injection</li>
					<li>Location: GET /passenger.json</li>
					<li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>
					<li>Description of issue: The client is able to inject MongoDB commands that will be executed by the database engine. Thus, in this case, one is able to access all the passengers of the ride-hailing service.</li>
					<li>Proof of vulnerability: For instance curl https://hans-moleman.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username[$ne]=random will yield the following: <img src="../security/real_solution6.png" alt="issue 6" width="600" height="200"></li>
					<li>Resolution: Use data validation to ensure that that the request's parameters are correctly formated.</li>
				</ul>

			<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
			<div> In the future, I would recommending getting an API key and have the server limit the range of user input via input validation and restrictions on input length. Both of the former examples would require a low cost to implement them. However, I wouldn't recommend completely overhauling the database to a noSQL database because it would also be vulnerable to injections and the cost would be too high.  </div>
