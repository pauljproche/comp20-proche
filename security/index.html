			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<div>I am perform a security assessmenting of a potentially vulnerable system. Specifically, I was hired as a security consultant to resolve privacy and security issues relating to a ride-hailing service. That is, I was hired to see if there were any notable vulnerablities in the source code and the package.json by the company.</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<h2>I will follow a two-step process of attacking the site</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Blackbox Approach: I will first perform attacks without reading the source code.</li>
				<li>Whitebox Approach: Then, I will manually review the source code and document my findings. If I find any large issues, such as source code that is potentially vulnerable to XSS, I will go back and attack it.</li>
			</li>
			<h2>Summary:</h2>
			<div>My methodology for pen testing the system will be to first understand the source code of the ride hailing service, the see if there are any apparent vulnerabilities that I can desern from the code, and final I will use tools such a Burp Suite and curl to locate vulnerabilities. I will loop through this process until I am certain that there are no more serious security and privacy issues with the ride-hailing service.</div>
