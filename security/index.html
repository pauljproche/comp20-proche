			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<div>I am perform a security assessmenting of a potentially vulnerable system. Specifically, I was hired as a security consultant to resolve privacy and security issues relating to a ride-hailing service. That is, I was hired to see if there were any notable vulnerablities in the source code and the package.json by the company.</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<h2>I will follow a two-step process of attacking the site</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Blackbox Approach: I will first perform attacks without reading the source code.</li>
				<li>Whitebox Approach: Then, I will manually review the source code and document my findings. If I find any large issues, such as source code that is potentially vulnerable to XSS, I will go back and attack it.</li>
			</li>
			<h2>Summary:</h2>
			<div>My methodology for pen testing the system will be to first understand the source code of the ride hailing service, the see if there are any apparent vulnerabilities that I can desern from the code, and final I will use tools such a Burp Suite and curl to locate vulnerabilities. I will loop through this process until I am certain that there are no more serious security and privacy issues with the ride-hailing service.</div>

			<h1>Issues Found</h1>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 1: CSP Scanner: Wildcard Directive</li>

					<li>Location</li>

					<li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>

					<li>Description of issue: The following directives either allow wildcard sources,
					 are not defined, or are overly broadly defined.</li>

					<li>Proof of vulnerability. screenshots necessary</li>

					<li>Resolution: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 2: X-Frame-Options Header Not Set</li>

					<li>Location</li>

					<li>Severity of issue: Medium</li>

					<li>Description of issue: X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.</li>

					<li>Proof of vulnerability. screenshots necessary</li>

					<li>Resolution: Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="issue_ele">
					<li>Issue 3: Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</li>
					<li>Location</li>
					<li>Severity of issue: Low</li>
					
					<li>Description of issue: No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form. A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user.</li>
					
					<li>Proof of vulnerability. screenshots necessary</li>
					<li>Resolution: Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.</li>
