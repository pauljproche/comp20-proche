1. I believe most aspects of my work have been correctly implemented. I was able to determine and mark my location on the map, I was able to make a successful request to the ride-hailing API, and I was able to send my username, latitude, and longitude. Furthermore, I was able to mark all the vehicles returned by the API and note the closest marker to my icon. Finally, I connected my marker to the closest vehicle via a polyline. I was unable to access the places API and tried creating a new API key to see if I could access the client-side version of Places, however I got stuck too frequently and gave up at the end.

2. I worked on this assignment by myself.

3. I spent around 4-6 hours working on tihs assignment. However, my lackluster planning make me underestimate how much time was necessary to fix small bugs and figuring out how to deal with asynchronousity. I don't plan on making the same mistake in the future. Fortunately, I did learn a lot about AJAX and the necessity for it as well as importance of simple console.log() commands to debug.
