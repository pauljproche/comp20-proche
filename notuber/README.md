1. I believe all aspects of my work have been correctly implemented. The index.html fulfills the list of instructions (i.e. map fills up entire page, seperate CSS/JS files, no JS mixed w/ html, and the map is centered at appropriate location) and there are all the appropriate files.

2. I worked on this assignment by myself.

3. I spent around 2-3 hours working on tihs assignment. However, I got stuck trying to get the map to load because I incorrectly ordered my <script> attributes in my index.html. Furthermore, I lost extra time trying to figure out how to load all the cars. Had I consulting stackoverflow and piazza earlier in the process of fixing my errors, I would have saved some time.
