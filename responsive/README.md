#comp20-proche
1. As far as I'm aware, everything has been correctly implemented. I covered the basics (i.e. correct GitHub repo name, exact file names, etc.), I created the README.md file, I completed the responsive.css style sheet which used media queries to display different images depending on the size of the browser screen, and finally, I didn't modify the HTML provided for me nor did I use a different image.

2. I worked on this lab by myself.

3. I spent about an hour working on this project. I got stuck trying to correctly implement sprites in the lab. That is, I forgot to specify 'px' of the url dimensions which caused me to lose some time.
